LK Debug/Console UART
---------------------
- USART2 is used
- TX is A2
- RX is A3
- both are on the P1 header near the top

Using ST-LINK VCP serial
------------------------

The onboard ST-LINK/V2 has a Virtual Com Port that is available over USB.
To use it, solder wires between:
- U2 pin 12 (ST-LINK_TX) and PA3 (USART2_RX) (e.g., pin 13 on header P1)
- U2 pin 13 (ST-LINK_RX) and PA2 (USART2_TX) (e.g., pin 14 on header P1)
And use UART2.

Using external SWD debug
------------------------
- Remove jumpers from CN3 4-pin header (near mini-usb connector)
- CN3 pin2 is SWCLK
- CN2 pin4 is SWDIO
- GND is available on P2, nearby
